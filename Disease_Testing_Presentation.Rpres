Scenario
========================================================

- Suppose you take a diagnostic screening test for a particular condition or disease.

- You test is postive.  What is the probability you have the disease?

- You test is negative.  What is the probability you have the disease?

- This Shiny application answers these questions.


Application:  User Inputs and Outputs
========================================================

User Inputs
- Prevalence:  Percent of the population that has the disease

- Sensitivity:  Detection rate of people with disease.  Also called the True Positive Rate.

- Specificity:  Detection rate of people without the disease.  Also called the True Negative Rate

Outputs
- Postive Predictive Value (PPV):  Given you a positive test result, the probability that you actually have the disease.

- False Omission Rate (FOR):  Given a negative test results, the probability that you actually have the disease.


How It Works
========================================================

```{r}
# Inputs
Prevalence  <- 0.09    
Sensitivity <- 0.41
Specificity <- 0.93

# Calculations & Outputs
print(PPV <- (Sensitivity * Prevalence) / ((Sensitivity * Prevalence + 
         (1 - Specificity)*(1 - Prevalence))))
print(FOR <- 1 - (Specificity * (1 - Prevalence)) / ((1- Sensitivity) * Prevalence + 
         (Specificity*(1 - Prevalence))))

```

Output: Plot
========================================================
```{r, echo = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
PPV <- round(PPV, 2)
FOR <- round(FOR, 2)

df2 <- data.frame(Outcome = c("PPV", "FOR", "Prevalence"), Metric = c(PPV, FOR, Prevalence))


ggplot(df2, aes(x = Outcome, y = Metric)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill="steelblue")+
      geom_text(aes(label = Metric), vjust=-0.3, size = 4) +
      theme_minimal() 
```

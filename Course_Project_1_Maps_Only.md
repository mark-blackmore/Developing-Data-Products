# In Brief - Interactive Maps of Major US Storms: 1996 - 2011
Mark Blackmore  
August 16, 2017  



## Introduction
This report explores the NOAA Storm Database and creates interactive maps, in the interest of answering two basic questions:  

1. Across the United States, which types of events have had at least ten million dollars in property damage? 
2. Across the United States, which types of events have had at least ten fatalities? 

Click on a circle or marker to see storm event type.
